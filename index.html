    <p>This page is about my trip to California and why it was one of the best vacations I've had.
        During my trip I got to see cool things like the city of San Francisco, the Alcatraz prison,
        and the giant sequoias of Sequoia National Forest.Though parts of the trip were tough, those rewards
    made each obstacle more than worth it.</p>

            <h3>At the Wharf tried some new things and we had to have sea food!</h3>
    <p>During my week long stay in Springville California with my girlfriend, we decided to take an early 
        morning drive to San Francisco to spend a day exploring that area. We booked a room at this small, 
        very cool nautical themed hotel called the Zephyr. The room wasn't huge, but if was beautiful and
        it served its purpose. Not having much time we utilized what he had by walking along the Fisherman's Wharf. 
        We walked the shops, had a delicious sea food dinner, and finished the night exploring the night life.</p>

            <h3><p>The history of Alcatraz is incredibly enthralling!</p></h3>
    <p class="alcatraz-text">After our day at the Wharf we spent a day touring the famous prison of Alcatraz. There was a ferry from the 
        pier at the Wharf that took us to Alcatraz Island, though the tour group was huge, the multi-level ferry 
        had plenty of space to accomodate. The tour started in the prison showers, or what was left of it. 
        The middle of the room had an outline of shower heads in the shape of a rectangle. The outer area of the 
        room contained the remains of what was once toilet stalls, but what now looked like rubble and holes in the floor.
        Then there was a cage along one of the far walls where they would hand out towels and a set of white uniforms after 
        the shower. Beyond the showers we visited the rest of the prison, including the cells, the visitors area, and the 
        cafeteria. Throughout the tour the guide spoke of the history from the assaults and murders among the prisoners, 
        the many escape attempts, to the eventual shutting down of the prison itself(due to it being deemed no help in a 
        prisoner rehabilitation and seen more as a place to put them to be forgotten).</p>

            <h3>The size of the General Sherman is said to be the largest in the world!</h3>
    <p>Even though Alcatraz was a great ending to our San Francisco trip, we still had one last goal before leaving California 
        and that was to visit the General Sherman giant sequoia. This trip involved less driving on the highways and more driving 
        up a mountain. Also, this trip was interesting from the very beginning because before we could even attempt going up the 
        mountain I had to learn how to install snow chains to our SUV. The drive 4,000ft up the mountain seemed to wind and turn 
        forever, but once we parked and got to the hike that was a lot shorter. The General Sherman and really the whole Sequoia 
        National Forest was an incredible site to visit. In a lot of the trees there are nooks in the base of the trunks that can 
        fit an entire person. It's a place a would love to visit again. </p>
